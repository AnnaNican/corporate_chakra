<h1>Corporate Chakra - Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>This document describes the data about you that we do not collect and the nefarious purposes we do not use it for. We don't care who you are, or where you came from, or what bad decisions lead you here. We're just glad you've decided to spend sometime with us. And legally, we need to tell you some things.
<h2>Legal Stuff We're Obligated to Disclose</h2>
<h3>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h3>
<p>Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person.</p>
<h4>What personal information we collect</h4>
<p>None. Nada. Zip. Zilch. We do not want to know anything personal about you... Except maybe your sign and hair color. However, if you tell us: your mother's maiden name, the name of your first pet, and your birthday then we shall open a line of credit in your <del>name</del> honor!</p>
<h4>How we use your personal information</h4>
<p>We are good at using nothing. We have lots of plans for nothing, especially your personal information that you have no way of giving us. If you manage to send us personal information, we will write it into the best novel of the 21st century. It'll be like the Bible (or the Torah or the Quran) but instead of being filled with tales of Jesus, Moses, and Mohamed, it will be filled with your personal information. You may be hero, you may be a villain, you may be the luckily side character who gets hit by a bus on page 3. We don't know yet, but we do know: you'll want to change your phone number... and maybe your email. Billions will read it. Movies, Netflix specials, and podcasts will be made about it. But right now it's just a blank page because we don't want your personal info.</p>
<h3>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h3>
<p>Sometimes we get info on you that we really dont want. Like those baby pictures of you bathing in the sink that your Mom always shows. We wish we didn't have to see it but we can't change your Mom. We also can't change the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store (or whoever you downloaded this from). They tell us things about you. We wish they didn't. We may know where you're from, what model phone you're using, a what language is setup as your default.</p>
<p>How will we use that non-personal information? Probably, we'll look at our developer accounts once in the next year and think "Wow, we have 5 users!" or "Who still has an iPhone 6!?" However, if you send us a self-addressed-stamped-evelope we will use this non-personal information to hunt you down like we're detectives and you're culprit who stole Ms. Platz's geraniums. Don't steal flowers. Water them! And don't give us any non-personal information!</p>
<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
<p>We don't use cookies! What do you think we are? A bakery!? We ain't no website either. If you came here looking for cookies - you got duped. Sorry. I hope you can find cookies elsewhere. They are quite tasty. If you know a good recipe... don't tell us! We don't want your information.</p>
<p>If your app has ads - you got duped. If your app asks your information - you got duped. If your app lets you input anything - you got duped. If your app does anything useful - you got duped. We do not have ads in our app and do not use 3rd parties or other technology to track you. The app may request internet permission. If it does - that's because we forgot to turn that permission off when we built it. We guarantee you: we neither need nor want more permissions. If the app asks you for any - just say NO!</p>
<h3>Disclosure to Third Parties</h3>
<p>We really don't like other people. It's a big leap to think that we would talk to people we don't like (everyone) about people we tolerate (you). If they want your info, they ain't getting it from us!</p>
<h3>Protection of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We take your personal information (that we do not collect) very seriously. As a matter of fact, we have a Chief Data Retention Officer. Her job is to stick her fingers in her ears and sing "I Don't Care" as loudly as she can while people try to tell her their personal information. Your personal information cannot survive that. We have additional safe-guards to make sure your personal information never gets into any hands. First, all complaints, bug reports, feedback and ratings go straight into the paper shredder! All our mail goes right there too. Take that spammers! Since most user will not write us a letter we have additional precautions on our email. Our email is configured as one big trash folder. It gets cleared daily. We asked my uncle who has Alzheimer's disease to set the password; he's the only one who used to know it.</p>
<h3>Privacy Questions</h3>
<p>If you have a question then send us a letter. Don't put a return address on it because that would be personal information and we don't want any of that. Once we receive your letter we will shred it. And recycle the scraps. We're an environmentally friendly company and we work hard to protect your personal and non-personal information.</p>
